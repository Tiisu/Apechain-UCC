BandwidthShare Mobile DApp - Comprehensive Project Overview
1. üì± Project Summary
BandwidthShare is a revolutionary mobile-first decentralized application (DApp) that transforms smartphones into micro internet service providers, enabling users across Africa to monetize their unused internet bandwidth while helping their communities access affordable connectivity.

Built on Ape Chain blockchain, BandwidthShare addresses one of Africa's most pressing digital challenges: the high cost of internet access. By creating a peer-to-peer bandwidth sharing network, the platform allows users to earn BWD (Bandwidth) tokens for sharing their unused internet capacity, which can then be converted to local currency or used to purchase mobile data bundles.

Target Market: African Mobile Users
Primary Focus: Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania
Target Demographics: Smartphone users aged 18-45 with internet access
Market Size: 500+ million mobile internet users across Africa
Key Pain Points: High data costs (up to 10% of monthly income), unreliable connectivity, limited financial services access
Core Mission
Democratize internet access across Africa by turning every smartphone into a community internet infrastructure node, creating economic opportunities while reducing connectivity costs for underserved populations.
